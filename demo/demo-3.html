            <p id="float1"><img src="logo.png" alt="Rafting site logo" /> set to 100px all round This will limit the size of the image but will also make the Paragraph text more than it. This is to introduce float and clear css properties.</p>
            <p class="class2"><img src="logo.png" alt="Rafting site logo" /> This is the second paragraph that is needed to know what the float properties really does. Going to make the paragraphs a little longer so that it'll be abel to enter three or two lines on the browser.</p>
