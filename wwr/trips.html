                    <p>Opening the duty part in the opening office hours, we start preparing to welcome our custmoers. Safe to say, the dorm is high-quality and contained for every one. Seperated into mail and female.</p>
                    <p>Checking into the dorm is easy. After that, we have a resturant, still around the dorms to fill our tommies before the raft.</p>

                    <h4>Samsil Palace</h4>
                    <p>Samsil does not only host the seas, but even the environment is picturques. There are old temples built way before the archanic era that still hold strong today. Tourist usually flock during them setting evenings to take stunning pictures that'll last their memories of Samsil.</p>

                    <p>Introducing the Dragon Waterfall, steaming to the dragon's valley. Resident's say the depths of this valley is as depe as the length of the earth. No one knows exactly hoow deep it is. Rafting in the dragon's waterfall is, exhillarting, to say in simple terms. You won't stop to have the fun and heart beating through your chest throughout your raft.</p>
                    <p>If the calm river is not your style, why don't you try something different for a start?</p>

                    <h4>Washgroom beauty</h4>

                    <p>Washgroom is located in the southern part of the country. It is connected directly to the atlantic ocean, but you won't see the Birmuda triangle.</p>
                    <p>Washgroom brings the exciting notion of rafting in the ever-chaning current of the sea. it is the mix of the dragon river and the samsil palace, and honestl, our customers love rafting in this cooling side of the sea.</p>
                    <p>Whether it is taking pictures of long winding caves of moss and statutes, or picking fresh abalone as you raft, the Washgroom won't disappoint you.</p>
